## Intro
This is my color application. Before I started pushing projects to GitHub, I did four React applications following tutorials. This, however, is my first original project in React. There is a lot of functionality here, so have fun playing around with all that you can do with this color picker application! 

## How to

### Run the app 
npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
